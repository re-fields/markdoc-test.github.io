## SDS Incubatorio

Markdoc is a static site generator that uses Markdown files as input and outputs HTML files.

Markdoc features several core concepts which include:

- **Nodes**:
  These are the elements that Markdoc inherits from Markdown
- **Tags**:
  Tags are the main syntactic extension that Markdoc adds on top of Markdown. Similar to HTML, each tag is enclosed with `{%` and `%}` and includes the tag name, attributes, and the content body.
- **Annotations**:
  These can be added to nodes to customize how they are rendered

### Installation

To install markdoc in Next.js, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @markdoc/next.js @markdoc/markdoc
```

### Background

Markdoc was built by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to power their developer documentation.
